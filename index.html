            <h3>Who we are</h3>
            <p>
              Fresh Station Eco Farm is a lifetime project of Jane and Will
              Barso, who started it as an exemplary way of living in harmony
              with the environment and eating healthy. Today, we are happy to
              cherish the full-functioning farm that was once a 20-acres amateur
              project, providing the customers with fresh products and teaching
              the ways to be more friendly to our planet.

            <p>
              Over the decades we established and improved the technology of
              growing and making organic products. Now, we can offer far more
              than just garden-grown products. We collect honey, make cheese,
              breed chickens, and cows. In addition to the fresh fruit and
              vegetables from our garden, we make jam, syrups, and bread. Check
              updates for the seasonal products in our online shop.

            <h3>Why organic?</h3>
            <p>
              In the 1970s, Jane and Will, inspired by the unraveling movement
              towards environmental sustainability and ecological mindfulness,
              strove to design a way of doing less damage to the planet and
              bring harmony between the food production and nature. That harmony
              manifests a healthy life and work attitude. Today our organic
              business is popular, and we are glad to offer our products and
              promote biodiversity as a better lifestyle.
